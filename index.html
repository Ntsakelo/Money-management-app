                        Purchasing financial products via financial advisors that earn commissions may be a matter of convenience,
                        especially if someone will receive a commission regardless of where you buy the product. 
                        What's important is understanding the difference. And if you work with a fee-based financial advisor, 
                        understand when they are acting as a fiduciary, especially when they help you purchase financial products.
