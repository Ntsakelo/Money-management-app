                        Below is the breakdown of the computed expenses and the amount you should be spending on each expense. Please review it and try to apply the suggested amount on each expense to better manage your money and be able to save or invest. The budget amount is the amount that you will have after all the expenses have been covered. The budget amount can be used to cover other arising costs that you may encounter during the course of the month.  
                        <!-- Purchasing financial products via financial advisors that earn commissions may be a matter of convenience,
                        especially if someone will receive a commission regardless of where you buy the product. 
                        What's important is understanding the difference. And if you work with a fee-based financial advisor, 
                        understand when they are acting as a fiduciary, especially when they help you purchase financial products. -->

                        {{lstName}}, with monthly savings of {{SavingAmount}} from your calculated savings, we expect your money to grow at a constant rate of {{SavingAmount}}. In a period of 5 months demonstrated by the graph, your amount would have grown 5 times more than the savings amount. After savings, we recommend that you invest your money with a reliable financial service provider. With investments, your returns will be much higher compared to savings.
